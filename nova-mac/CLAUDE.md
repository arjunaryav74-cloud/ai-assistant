# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

`nova-mac` is the native macOS Electron companion to the Next.js web app one level up
(`../CLAUDE.md`). It is a tray-only voice assistant with an always-on-top orb window and a
full-featured app window. It shares the **same Supabase backend and schema** as the web app
(auth, `conversations`, `messages`, `memories`, `user_preferences`, `reminders`,
`google_oauth_tokens`) but is a completely separate codebase, build system, and runtime.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # electron-vite dev (main + preload + renderer with HMR)
npm run build        # tsc --noEmit  +  electron-vite build  (THIS is the type/lint gate)
npm test             # vitest run (all *.test.ts)
npm run test:watch   # vitest watch
npm run dist         # build + electron-builder --mac (signed/notarized .dmg)
npm run wake:models  # download the openWakeWord ONNX models into electron/wakeword/models

npx tsc --noEmit                          # type-check only
npx vitest run electron/wakeword/framing.test.ts   # run one test file
npx vitest run -t "AudioRingBuffer"                # run tests matching a name
```

There is **no ESLint / no lint script**. TypeScript strict mode is the only static gate;
`npm run build` (or `npx tsc --noEmit`) is what catches errors before commit. Tests are
colocated `*.test.ts` files run by Vitest in a Node environment.

## Three-process / three-build architecture

electron-vite produces three independent bundles (`electron.vite.config.ts`):

| Target | Entry | Output | Notes |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| main | `electron/main.ts` **and** `electron/wakeword/worker.ts` | `out/main/` | Two entries — the wake worker must be its own file because it runs in a `worker_threads` Worker. |
| preload | `electron/preload.ts` | `out/preload/` | Forced to **CJS** (`format: "cjs"`) — Electron's sandbox rejects ESM preload, and `"type":"module"` would otherwise emit `.mjs`. |
| renderer | `index.html` → `src/main.tsx` | `out/renderer/` | React 19 + Tailwind v4 + framer-motion. Single bundle for both windows. |

`onnxruntime-node` and `ws` are marked **`external`** in the main rollup config: they load
native `.node` bindings via dynamic `require` at runtime and cannot be statically bundled.

The `@shared/*` path alias (→ `shared/`) is declared in **three** places that must stay in
sync: `tsconfig.json`, `electron.vite.config.ts`, and `vitest.config.ts`.

## Two-window model

The app has two distinct windows that share a single renderer bundle:

| Window | Size | Style | Purpose |
|--------|------|-------|---------|
| Orb (`orbWin`) | 96×96 mini ↔ 380×520 panel | frameless, transparent, always-on-top (screen-saver level) | Persistent Siri-style orb, user-draggable; expands into the chat panel |
| App (`appWin`) | 920×680 | framed, hiddenInset title bar, vibrancy | Settings / Reminders / Memory / Connections tabs |

`src/main.tsx` calls `nova().getWindowMode()` at mount → renders `<App />` (orb) or
`<AppShell />` (app window). `GetWindowMode` IPC compares the sender's `webContents.id` to the
orb window's id: orb → `"orb"`, anything else → `"app"`.

- **Open app window**: orb ⚙ button → `nova().appOpen()` → hides orb, shows/creates app window.
- **Back to orb**: AppDock home icon → `nova().appClose()` → hides app, shows orb.
- **Tray**: "Open Nova" menu item creates/shows app window independently.

**Siri-style orb lifecycle**: the orb window (`MiniOrb.tsx`, 96×96 transparent) is **hidden by
default** and only appears when something activates it — never shown just because it finished
loading (`createOrbWindow` in `window.ts` does not auto-show in dev or prod). Main tracks this
with `orbArmedForAutoHide` in `main.ts`:
- **System activation** (wake word, timer fire) → `activateOrb()` shows the mini orb and arms
  auto-hide. Once the voice turn ends (`VoiceTurnEnded`) with the panel still collapsed, or a
  system-driven collapse lands via `OrbSetExpanded(false)` while still armed, the window is
  hidden outright (not just shrunk).
- **Manual activation** (orb click, `Cmd+Shift+Space`, tray "Open Nova", closing the Settings
  window) → disarms auto-hide and force-shows the window; collapsing afterward only shrinks it
  back to the mini orb, it does not vanish.
`IpcChannel.OrbSetExpanded(on, manual?)` carries this distinction from the renderer; when no
custom position is set, main resizes/positions top-right-anchored via `resizeOrb`/
`positionOrbTopRight` (`window.ts`) and broadcasts `IpcChannel.OrbExpandedChanged`.

**Dragging**: `MiniOrb.tsx` marks its whole window `WebkitAppRegion: "drag"` (Chromium still
delivers the underlying mousedown/mouseup to React even inside a drag region, so a movement
threshold in the component tells a click from a drag) and the expanded panel's icon-button strip
is a drag region too. `main.ts` listens for the window's native `moved` event to detect *real*
user drags — `orbMoveIsProgrammatic` + `moveOrbProgrammatically()` suppress the `moved` events
our own `positionOrbTopRight`/`resizeOrb`/`setPosition` calls trigger, since Electron fires
`moved` for programmatic changes too and there's no other way to tell them apart. Once a real
drag is detected, `orbUserPositioned` flips on and the spot is persisted via
`electron/orb-position-store.ts` (plain JSON under `userData`, restored on next launch);
`positionOrb()` becomes a no-op as long as `isPointOnAnyDisplay` says that spot is still on
some connected display. `watchDisplayChanges` (called once on `orbWin` in `main.ts`) falls back
to the default top-right corner and clears `orbUserPositioned` if a monitor change leaves the
saved spot off-screen.

**Jelly wiggle while dragging**: separately from `moved`, `main.ts` also listens to the
cross-platform `move` event (fires continuously *during* a drag, unlike `moved`) to compute
live velocity and broadcast it as `IpcChannel.OrbDragVelocity`. `useOrbDragWiggle`
(`src/hooks/useOrbDragWiggle.ts`) turns that into a squash-and-stretch transform — pure math in
`velocityToWiggle()` (tested in isolation, no React/DOM needed) stretches the orb along the
direction of motion and squashes it perpendicular, capped so it can't grow enough to clip its
window; the hook self-decays back to neutral if no new velocity tick arrives within 140ms. Both
`MiniOrb.tsx` and the expanded panel's orb (`Orb.tsx`) wrap `VoiceOrb` in a `motion.div` driven
by this hook with `jellySpring` (`src/motion/springs.ts`) for the bouncy settle.

Voice turns (listening/thinking/speaking/barge-in) **never**
auto-expand the panel — the orb's own color is the only feedback while it stays a corner orb;
only a timer notice auto-expands (`hasNotice` effect in `src/App.tsx`), collapsing itself again
~2.5s after the notice clears. The reducer's `settle` event ends a turn while keeping the
conversation text visible in the panel; typed messages go through `useVoice().sendText` (no
TTS, no barge-in) so replies stream in even when opened manually.

## The IPC contract (single source of truth)

`shared/types.ts` defines the `IpcChannel` enum plus every request/response type. The contract
has three layers that must always agree when you add or change a channel:

1. `shared/types.ts` — add the `IpcChannel` member + payload types.
2. `electron/preload.ts` — expose a method on `window.nova` (typed in `src/lib/ipc.ts`).
3. Handler registration — note the split:
   - `electron/ipc.ts` → `registerIpcHandlers` (auth, sync, transcribe, synthesize), `registerChatBridge`, `registerWakeBridge`.
   - `electron/main.ts` `app.whenReady()` → all other handlers registered directly via `ipcMain.handle`: window management, prefs, reminders, memory, connections.

Actual handler implementations are wired in `main.ts` via lazy `import()` so heavy modules
don't load at startup.

## App lifecycle & windowing (`electron/main.ts`)

- `dotenv` loads `.env.local` then `.env` **at the very top** before anything reads
  `process.env` — electron-vite does not auto-load env for the main process.
- Tray-only: `app.dock?.hide()`, `window-all-closed` is a no-op (app keeps running).
- Global hotkey `Cmd+Shift+Space` toggles the orb window.
- `nova://` deep-link protocol: `open-url` routes:
  - `nova://auth-callback` → `handleAuthCallback` (Supabase magic-link)
  - `nova://connections-callback` → `handleConnectionsCallback` (Google OAuth token exchange)
- The native probe (`electron/native-probe`) is loaded lazily via `bindings` and is **expected
  to fail in dev** (no compiled addon) — that failure is swallowed to one warn line.

## Auth & Supabase

- Magic-link OTP (`auth.signInWithOtp`) with `emailRedirectTo: nova://auth-callback`.
  `handleAuthCallback` tolerates both hash-token and `?code=` (PKCE) callback shapes.
- Sessions are persisted **encrypted** via Electron `safeStorage` (Keychain) to
  `userData/session.bin` — see `electron/session-store.ts`. Supabase client itself runs with
  `persistSession: false`; we restore manually on boot via `restoreSession()`.
- `electron/supabase.ts` builds the client with a Node `ws` realtime transport.
- `electron/sync.ts`: read-only list of conversations/memories. **Never `select("embedding")`**
  on `memories` — it is ~6 KB of floats per row.

## Voice turn — the core flow

A full interaction is orchestrated in `src/hooks/useVoice.ts` (renderer). The mic stream and
Web Audio live in the renderer; STT/TTS/chat calls cross IPC to the main process (which holds
the API keys).

```
wake word fires (main)  ──activateOrb + IPC WakeDetected──▶  useVoice.runTurn()
  orb: summon → listening          (wake cue plays unless instantAckMode === "off")
  recordUntilSilence(stream)       // MediaRecorder until VAD silence (prefs.silenceMs)
  ──IPC transcribe──▶ electron/voice/stt.ts (OpenAI Whisper/gpt-4o-transcribe)
  sanitizeTranscript() + isVoiceStopPhrase()   // drop hallucinated noise / kill words silently
  orb: submit(transcript) → processing
  ──IPC chatSend──▶ electron/chat.ts (Anthropic streaming) ──ChatDelta/Done/Error──▶
  orb: responseStart → responseDelta…    // color/text update, panel stays collapsed unless opened
  VoicePlayer.playStreaming()            // sentence-by-sentence TTS, prefetched
  barge-in: TtsBargeInListener stops playback + chatCancel + restarts a turn (orb: bargeIn, orange)
  endTurn() ──IPC voiceTurnEnded──▶ main re-arms wake scoring, auto-hides the orb if unopened
  (if interactionMode === "conversation": runTurn() instead of endTurn())
```

- **Orb UI is a pure reducer**: `src/orb/orb-machine.ts` states: `dormant → listening →
  processing → responding`, plus `working`/`error`/`bargeIn`. `summon` from `"bargeIn"` stays
  `"bargeIn"` (not `"listening"`) — `runTurn()` dispatches `bargeIn` then `summon` in the same
  tick, and React 18 batches both into one render, so resetting to `"listening"` here would
  make the orange barge-in color never actually paint. `submit` accepts both `"listening"` and
  `"bargeIn"` so the follow-up utterance after an interrupt still reaches `"processing"`.
- **Kill words / noise filtering** (`src/voice/stop-phrases.ts`, `transcript-filter.ts`,
  ported from the web app): every transcript from `recordUntilSilence` is run through
  `sanitizeTranscript()` in `useVoice.ts` before it ever reaches Claude. An empty result means
  STT hallucinated on background noise/silence — dropped silently, no sound, no chat call.
  `isVoiceStopPhrase()` catches dismissals ("stop", "that'll be all", "thank you very much",
  etc.) — acknowledged with the `gotIt` cue and the turn ends without calling Claude at all.
- **WebGL VoiceOrb** (`src/components/orb/webgl-voice-orb.ts` + `VoiceOrb.tsx` wrapper): a
  fluid-noise plasma sphere (ported from a user-supplied reference), 4 color states — idle=grey,
  thinking=purple, speaking=green, bargein=orange — smoothly lerped (rate 0.22/frame, tuned for
  snappy but not jarring transitions). `VoiceOrb`'s 6-value `visualMode` collapses onto these 4;
  `listening` reads as idle. Same external API as the old Canvas2D orb it replaced.
- **Streaming TTS** (`src/voice/player.ts`): a `SentenceBuffer` chunks the streamed reply into
  sentences; chunks are synthesized ahead (prefetch depth 2) and scheduled gaplessly on a
  Web Audio timeline. `stop()`/barge-in aborts in-flight synth + sources.
- **Voice preferences** come from Supabase `user_preferences.voice` (JSONB) merged over
  `DEFAULT_VOICE_PREFERENCES` in `shared/types.ts`. Default interaction mode is `wake_word`.
- **Error states**: mic unavailable, recording failure, empty transcript, and chat errors all
  dispatch `{ type: "error", message }` → 2.5s auto-dismiss (not silent).
- **Audio cues** (`src/voice/earcon.ts`): oscillator-synthesized cues (`wake`, `gotIt`,
  `reply`, `bargeIn`, `error`, `timer`) played at each turn stage; gated by
  `prefs.audioCuesEnabled`.
- **Tool progress**: main emits `IpcChannel.ChatToolUse` `{requestId, toolName, step}` before
  each tool round; `useVoice` dispatches `startWorking` so the orb shows the friendly step label
  (labels in `TOOL_STEP_LABELS`, `electron/chat-turn.ts`). The next `ChatDelta` auto-returns
  the reducer from `working` to `responding`.
- **Recording**: `recordUntilSilence` gives up after 6s of no speech (empty blob → "Nothing
  heard" without an STT round-trip); speech threshold derives from `listeningSensitivity`.

## Mac control tools

`electron/tools/mac-control.ts` (volume via `osascript`, brightness via the optional
`brightness` CLI with a System Events key-code fallback, `open -a` for apps,
`shell.openExternal` for URLs — the `electron` import is lazy so vitest can load the module)
plus `electron/timers.ts` (session-scoped `TimerManager`, initialized in `main.ts` with an
on-fire callback that shows a Notification, summons the orb, and broadcasts
`IpcChannel.TimerFired`). Exposed to Claude as: `set_timer` / `list_timers` / `cancel_timer`,
`open_app` / `quit_app` / `open_url`, `set_system_volume` / `get_system_volume`,
`set_screen_brightness`.

## Chat turn — memory + history (`electron/chat.ts`)

`runTurn` / `runTurnStream` orchestrate the full chat turn with memory parity to the web app:

- Loads last N messages from the active conversation (`electron/memory/client.ts`)
- Runs `preRetrieveContext` — hybrid pgvector + `pg_trgm` memory search, calendar, Gmail, reminders
- Builds system prompt with dynamic memory injection
- Calls Claude with `MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS = 3`; tool results feed back into Claude
- Persists user + assistant messages to Supabase after each turn
- **Never `select("embedding")`** — memory queries always use an explicit column list

## App window — tabs (`src/AppShell.tsx`)

Auth-gated. 28 px draggable title bar inset. Tab state via `useState<Tab>`. AppDock fixed at bottom.

| Tab | Page | Main-process module |
|-----|------|-------------------|
| Settings | `src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx` (macOS System Settings style: sidebar sections General / Voice & Speech / Conversation / Sounds / Proactive / Account; toggles+selects save immediately, sliders debounce 500ms) | `electron/voice/save-preferences.ts` |
| Reminders | `src/pages/RemindersPage.tsx` | `electron/memory/reminders.ts` |
| Memory | `src/pages/MemoryPage.tsx` | `electron/memory/manage.ts` |
| Connections | `src/pages/ConnectionsPage.tsx` | `electron/google/connections.ts` |

**Preferences IPC**: `PrefsGet` returns `AllPrefs` (`voice` + `proactive`). After `PrefsSet`,
main broadcasts `IpcChannel.PrefsChanged` with `updated.voice` to **all** windows so the orb's
`useVoice` stays in sync without a reload.

**Proactive prefs** map camelCase `ProactivePrefs` ↔ snake_case DB columns: `proactiveMode` →
`proactive_tier`, `dailyBriefEnabled` → `brief_enabled` (see `save-preferences.ts`).

## Google OAuth (`electron/google/connections.ts`)

One row per user in `google_oauth_tokens`. Columns: `encrypted_refresh` (AES-256-GCM via
`electron/google/crypto.ts`), `scopes text[]`, `calendar_connected`, `gmail_connected`,
`youtube_connected`, `connected_email`. **Not** per-service rows.

Flow: `startOAuthFlow` → `shell.openExternal(url)` → user authenticates → macOS delivers
`nova://connections-callback` → `handleConnectionsCallback` exchanges code, encrypts refresh
token, upserts row, sends `IpcChannel.ConnectionsCallback` to app window → `ConnectionsPage`
refreshes status.

**One-time setup**: add `nova://connections-callback` as an authorized redirect URI in your
Google OAuth 2.0 client at console.cloud.google.com. Requires `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`,
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `GOOGLE_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32-byte key) in `.env.local`.

## Design system

- **Tailwind v4** via `@tailwindcss/postcss` (not the v3 direct plugin). Config in
  `tailwind.config.ts`; PostCSS in `postcss.config.cjs` (`.cjs` because `"type":"module"`).
  `src/styles/global.css` must use the v4 `@import "tailwindcss";` directive — the old v3
  `@tailwind base/components/utilities` at-rules are **silently no-ops** under
  `@tailwindcss/postcss` (no build error, just almost no CSS output), which is exactly what
  happened once and made every Tailwind-classed component render as unstyled default HTML
  while inline-styled components (which don't depend on Tailwind) looked fine. If a page ever
  looks suspiciously plain/unstyled again, check this first before assuming it's a design issue.
- **CSS tokens** in `src/styles/glass.css`: `--nova-bg`, `--nova-surface`, `--nova-border`,
  `--nova-text`, `--nova-text-secondary`, `--nova-accent`, `--nova-radius-card`, `.nova-glass`,
  `.nova-slider` (pill-track range input styling used by Settings sliders).
- **UI primitives**: `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`, `Card.tsx`, `Select.tsx` (pill-shaped,
  `rounded-full`, with a custom chevron since it uses `appearance-none`).
- **`cn()`** helper in `src/lib/utils.ts` (clsx + tailwind-merge).
- **Settings page** (`src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`) uses a black/grey pill design language:
  `rounded-full` sidebar nav with a soft `bg-white/[0.09]` highlight + small accent dot for the
  active section (not a solid accent fill), `Group` cards at `rounded-[22px]` with a low-contrast
  border and faint tinted row dividers instead of hard 1px lines, and pill-shaped selects/kbd
  chips/time inputs/buttons throughout.

## Wake word pipeline (openWakeWord, "Hey Jarvis")

Capture (renderer) → ONNX inference (main worker thread). Getting any step wrong silently
produces near-zero scores rather than an error, so the exact contract matters:

- `src/voice/wake-capture.ts`: an `AudioContext({sampleRate:16000})` resamples the mic and
  emits **Int16, 16 kHz mono, 1280-sample (~80 ms) frames** (`SAMPLES_PER_FRAME` in
  `shared/wake-constants.ts`) over `IpcChannel.WakeAudioFrame`.
- `electron/wakeword/index.ts` (`WakeWordController`, main thread): forwards frames to the
  worker, applies a fire threshold (default `0.05`), debounce, and an arm/re-arm gate; pauses
  during a voice turn and resumes on `voiceTurnEnded`.
- `electron/wakeword/worker.ts` + `engine.ts`: three-stage ONNX pipeline
  `melspectrogram.onnx → embedding_model.onnx → hey_jarvis_v0.1.onnx`. **Preprocessing the
  models were trained on (all four are required or scores flatline near 0):**
  1. Feed the mel model **raw int16-scale** float32 (≈±32768), **not** normalized [-1,1].
  2. Normalize the mel **output** with `value/10 + 2` before the embedding model.
  3. Stream mel with a **480-sample (3-hop) context prefix** so each 1280-sample chunk yields
     8 continuously-aligned frames (window=640/40 ms, hop=160/10 ms, `frames(N)=N/160−3`).
  4. Emit **one embedding per 8 mel frames** (openWakeWord window=76, step=8) so the
     16-embedding wake input spans ~1.3 s — not one embedding per frame.
- Models live in `electron/wakeword/models/` (fetch with `npm run wake:models`) and are bundled
  for production via `extraResources` → `wakeword-models` in `electron-builder.json`.

## Packaging notes (`electron-builder.json`)

- `asarUnpack: ["**/*.node"]` keeps native addons outside the asar so they load post-sign.
- `hardenedRuntime` + `notarize` + `build/entitlements.mac.plist` — a successful install logs
  `[nova] native probe: native-ok` on first launch, confirming the addon survived
  signing/notarization. Signing needs `CSC_LINK`/`CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` and
  `APPLE_ID`/`APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`/`APPLE_TEAM_ID` in the environment (see `README.md`).

## Environment variables

Local dev minimum (`.env.local`): `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`,
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` (STT + TTS). Google integrations need `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`,
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` only if using
Deepgram TTS. Model overrides: `ANTHROPIC_MODEL_LIGHT` (default `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`),
`OPENAI_STT_MODEL`.
